# Premier League Rest Api  

## Motivations behind this project  

I am currently working on a machine learning model that predicts the final results of Premier League football matches. In order to be able to make these predictions, the model requires statistical data on each player and each team during the matches. 
To make the data ingestion process more fluid it is almost essential to have a database and a rest api to issue queries against this database. 
This api will be part of a data pipeline which is also under development

## Objectives 
- Program a rest api to serve previously collected data from the English football championships.

## Project structure

Below you can see the structure of the rest api. The major components will be detailled in further steps.
